# AWS-Infrastructure-Provisioning-Script

**Description:** <br>
Built a script that automates the provisioning and configuration management of a virtual infrastructure in AWS. 
Used an AWS API, and Python to create and configure virtual machines, networking components, security groups, and other resources. 
Utilized Python library Boto3 for AWS.
<br>
**Key Aspects:** <br>
APIs and web services, configuration management, cloud automation, scripting.
<br>
**Additional Instructions:** <br>
To use this script, make sure you have the necessary credentials configured, including the appropriate AWS access key and secret access key. 
Replace the placeholders (e.g., 'ami-xxxxxxxx', 'sg-xxxxxxxx', 'subnet-xxxxxxxx', 'my-keypair.pem', 'vpc-xxxxxxxx') with the actual values corresponding to your AWS environment.

Feel free to modify the script according to your specific requirements, add error handling, or include additional provisioning and configuration functions as needed.
